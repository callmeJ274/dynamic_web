					<h2>Story 2: The River Isn't Deep</h2>
					<p>
						A stranger on horse back came to a river with which he was unfamiliar. The traveller asked a youngster if it was deep. <br>
						"No", replied the boy, and the rider started to cross, but soon found that he and his horse had to swim for their lives. <br>
						When the traveller reached the other side he turned and shouted : "I thought you said it wasn't deep ?" <br>
						"It isn't", was the boy's reply : "it only takes grandfather's ducks up to their middles !"
